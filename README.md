# Turborepo + NextJS + Shadcn + Storybook starter

This is a starter template for [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo) with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) and [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/).

It is very minimal and includes only the essentials needed to get started. I've created this template to help me get started with my projects faster.

If you wish for a version without Storybook, please check out [turborepo-shadcn-ui](https://github.com/dan5py/turborepo-shadcn-ui) by dan5py.

## What's inside?

This Turborepo includes the following packages/apps:

### Apps and Packages

- `docs`: a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app
- `web`: another [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app
- `ui`: a ui library using shadcn-ui
- `eslint-config-custom`: `eslint` configurations (includes `eslint-config-next` and `eslint-config-prettier`)
- `tsconfig`: `tsconfig.json`s used throughout the monorepo

Each package/app is 100% [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

### Utilities

This Turborepo has some additional tools already setup for you:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static type checking
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code linting
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io) for code formatting

### Build

To build all apps and packages, run the following command:

```
cd my-turborepo
pnpm build
```

### Develop

To develop all apps and packages, run the following command:

```
cd my-turborepo
pnpm dev
```

I've also included various scripts to help you develop your apps and packages:

- `dev:docs`: develop the `docs` app
- `dev:web`: develop the `web` app
- `dev:both`: develop both the `docs` and `web` apps
- `dev:ui`: develop the `ui` package with Storybook

There's probably a better way to do this, but I haven't figured it out yet. If you know how to do this, please let me know.

### Remote Caching

Turborepo can use a technique known as [Remote Caching](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/core-concepts/remote-caching) to share cache artifacts across machines, enabling you to share build caches with your team and CI/CD pipelines.

By default, Turborepo will cache locally. To enable Remote Caching you will need an account with Vercel. If you don't have an account you can [create one](https://vercel.com/signup), then enter the following commands:

```
cd my-turborepo
npx turbo login
```

This will authenticate the Turborepo CLI with your [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/personal-accounts/overview).

Next, you can link your Turborepo to your Remote Cache by running the following command from the root of your Turborepo:

```
npx turbo link
```
